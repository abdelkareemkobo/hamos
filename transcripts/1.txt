 Many people think that the best way to escape war is to dwell upon its horrors and to imprint them vividly upon the minds of the younger generations. They flaunt the grizzly photographs before their eyes. They fill their ears with tales of carnage. They dilate upon the ineppeditude of generals and admins. They denounce the crime and incensate follow of human strikes. Now all this teaching ought to be very useful in preventing us from attacking or invading any other country. If anyone outside a madhouse with the do-so. But how would it help us if we were attacked or invaded ourselves? That is the question we have to ask. The invaders consent to the eight-lord Bivabraqs exhibition. All listened to the impassioned appeals of Mr. Lloyd George. Would they agree to meet that famous South African General Smatz and have their inferiority complex removed in friendly, reasonable debate? I doubt it. I have born responsibility for the safety of this country. I agree with the time. But even if they did, I am not so sure we should convince them and persuade them to go back quietly home. They might say, it seems to me, you are rich. We are poor. You seem well fed. We are hungry. You have been victorious. We have been defeated. You have valuable colonists. We have none. You have your native. Where is ours? You have had the past. Let us have the future. Above all, I fear they would say, you are weak and we are strong. After all, my friends, you know they are few are the way by air that well in the nation of nearly 70 million of the most educated, industrial, scientific, disciplined people in the world. Who are being taught from childhood to think of war as a glorious exercise and death in battle as the noblest fate for man. There is a nation which at the bend and all its liberties in order to augment its collective strength. There is a nation which with all its strength and virtue is in the grip of a group of ruthless men preaching a gospel of intolerance and racial pride, unrestrained by law by parliament or by public opinion. In that country, all pacific speeches, or morbid war books are forbidden or suppressed and are author of rigorously in Britain. On their new table of commandments, they have omitted, thou shalt not kill. It is for twenty years since these neighbors of ours fought almost the whole world and almost defeated them. Now they are re-arming with the utmost speed and ready to their hands is this new lamentable weapon of the air. Against which our navy has no defense and before which women and children the weakened frail, the pacific standard jingle, the warrior and the civilian, the front line trenches and the cottage foam, or lies in equal and impartial period. May were still for with the new weapons and common new methods, or rather had come back the most brutish methods of ancient barbarism, namely the possibility of compelling the submission of racism by terrorizing and torturing their civil population. And worse of all, the more civilized the country is, the larger and more standard cities, the more intricate the structure of its social and economic life, the more it is vulnerable, the more it is the mercy of those who may make it their prey. Now these effects are grim indiscutable facts and in face of these facts I ask again what are we to do.
